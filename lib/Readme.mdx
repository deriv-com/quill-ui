**Installation**

To incorporate Quill UI into your applications, follow these steps:

**Usage**

Quill UI components are designed to be easily incorporated into your application. Simply import the desired components and use them according to your requirements. To use the Quill UI components, consumers need to wrap their application in the ThemeProvider and BreakpointProvider components. This ensures that the components have access to the necessary theme and responsive design information.

Example:

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider, BreakpointProvider, Button } from "@deriv-com/quill-ui";
import { theme } from "./path-to-your-theme-handling";

const App = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}> //dark or light
        <BreakpointProvider>
            {/* Your components go here */}
            <Button>Your Button Text</Button>
        </BreakpointProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```
